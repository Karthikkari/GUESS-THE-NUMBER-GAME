----GUESS THE NUMBER IN JAVA----
The "Guess the Number" game in Java is a simple console-based application where the computer randomly selects a number within a predefined range (from 1 to 100).
The player is prompted to guess the number, and after each guess, the program provides feedback, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. 
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.
This basic program helps reinforce concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling in Java.
